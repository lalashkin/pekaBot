# pekaBot
Setting up:
1. Create config.yaml file and add this strings to it:
BOT_TOKEN: "Your TG bot token"
BOT_USERNAME: "@"

VK_APPID: "Your VK app id"
VK_LOGIN: "Your VK login"
VK_PASSWD: "Your Pass"

VK_CHATID: "Chat ID, from where you want to get your messages"
TG_CHATID: "Chat, whrere you want to send the messages"

2. Run the script, it should work, kinda...


###########
Bot that sends VK messages to Telegram, whith attachments 'n stuff. Works only with group messages.
Market stuff is not implemented yet, and I dont think this will be neccesary. 
Same goes with wall replies, none are actually sends them as messages.
TODO:
Maybe, if VK API is not that shitty I'll add Telegram to VK compatibility. But that's not for shure.
